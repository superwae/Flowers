# Flower Classifier Project

This project is a machine learning application that classifies images of flowers using a deep learning model. The model is built using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub, and it is capable of predicting the class of a flower from an image.

# Setup

**Create a virtual environment**:
`bash
    python -m venv myenv
    `

**Activate the virtual environment**: - On Windows:
`bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ` - On macOS/Linux:
`bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        `

**Install the required packages**:
`bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    `

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the `ai.py` script. This script will load the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset, create training, validation, and test sets, build and train the model, and save the trained model.

# Example Command

python predict.py test_images/hard-leaved_pocket_orchid.jpg --top_k 5 --category_names label_map.json

# Example Output

Predictions for the image:
1: hard-leaved pocket orchid with probability 0.9971
2: bearded iris with probability 0.0019
3: canterbury bells with probability 0.0002
4: anthurium with probability 0.0001
5: moon orchid with probability 0.0001
